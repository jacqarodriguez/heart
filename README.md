# What are the significant predictors of the occurrence of heart diseases?
by Double O 5

## Summary
In this research project, we aim to focus on heart diseases, a subcategory of CVDs, and unravel their significant predictors, contributing to the global fight against CVDs. Our main research question is: "What are the significant predictors of the occurrence of heart diseases?". In the end, our logistic regression model will be able to predict, even for new data, if a patient has heart disease based on a collection of the predictor variables listed above that make it into our final model.
